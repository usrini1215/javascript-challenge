# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation (D3.js, html, CSS)

###  Background - This is a project that takes UFO sighting data and using Javascript filters data as needed and displays in html format.

1. **Dataset**

* [UFO Sightings Data](/static/js/data.js)
data.js
has the following structure :
[{
    datetime: "",
    city: "",
    state: "",
    country: "",
    shape: "",
    durationMinutes: "",
    comments: ""
  }}

2.  **UFO-level-1** 
Automatic Table and Date Search:
This folder has the index.html, app.js and data.js to do a simple filter on just the datetime field.  I have added a message as to what date was selected by the user.  Once the user picks a date, a table is generated by filtering data for just that date.  The table displays `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.


3. **UFO-level-2**
Multiple Search Categories:
This folder has the index.html, app.js and data.js to do a filter based on the dropdown values.  I have added a message as to what data was selected by the user, depending on the choice, the data gets filtered.  The following columns are in the dropdown and can be searched on :
1. `date/time`
2. `city`
3. `state`
4. `country`
5. `shape`

**Note **
For both search types, if the filter search doesnt return any results, I show the whole table to take us back to the whole data set instead of an empty table.
